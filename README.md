# Bank Loan Report Project

## Introduction
This project aims to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report for monitoring and assessing our bank's lending activities and performance. The report will provide insights into key loan-related metrics, distinguish between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans,' and offer detailed analysis through various dashboards.

## Domain Knowledge
Bank loans are crucial financial tools for individuals and businesses, enabling them to achieve their goals and manage financial needs. Banks collect loan data through various channels and processes, including loan applications, credit reports, internal records, online portals, and third-party data sources.

## Process of Granting a Loan
The process of granting a loan involves multiple steps, including loan application, application review, identity verification, credit check, income verification, DTI check, employment verification, collateral assessment (if applicable), risk assessment, loan approval or denial, loan agreement, disbursement of funds, repayment, and ongoing monitoring.

## Reasons for Analyzing Bank Loan Data
Banks analyze loan data for risk assessment, decision-making, portfolio management, fraud detection, regulatory compliance, customer insights, profitability analysis, market research, credit risk management, and customer retention.
